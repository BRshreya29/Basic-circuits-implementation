# Basic-circuits-implementation
This repository contains implementations of basic circuits such as Adder, Decoder, MUX, D-Flip Flop, etc., using Verilog coding. Additionally, it specifies that these implementations are provided in three different modeling styles: Behavioral model, Dataflow model, and Gate-level model.
